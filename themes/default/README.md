At this time the default theme is hardcoded in retro-go. You can find some of its values in those places:

- `components/retro-go/rg_gui.c`
- `launcher/main/gui.c`
- `launcher/main/images/`

At some point all of that stuff will be moved here...

But in the mean time, if you're looking to build your own theme, you can use the `example` theme as a template instead.
